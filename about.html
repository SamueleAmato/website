<p>I’m a 19-year-old developer with a passion for low-level programming and systems development. I enjoy writing elegant, minimalist code—even if it can be a bit tricky to read sometimes. My approach is to break problems into simple logical layers, tackle them with concrete data, and then abstract the solution.

I mainly work with C, Rust, Java, Go, and Assembly, but I like exploring other languages just for the fun of it. A big part of my work revolves around open-source projects, especially the suckless ones in C, and I regularly share my experiments and tools on GitHub. My projects span a wide range: steganography tools, OSINT toolkits, CLI music players, and embedded systems. <a href="https://samueleamato.xyz/2025/07/30/hardware-i-use">Here</a>'s the gear I use
